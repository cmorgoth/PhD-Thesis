The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector operates at the LHC at CERN. It was designed to operate in proton-proton (and lead-lead)
collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 14\TeV (5.5\TeV) and at
luminosities up to 10$^{34}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$
(10$^{27}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$). The CMS has cilindrical geometry and
its dimensions are a length of 21.5 m, a diameter of 14.6, and a total
weight of 12,500 tons. At the heart of the CMS detector system
lies a 4\unit{T} magnetic field produced by a large-bore superconducting
solenoid which encloses a silicon -- pixel and strips -- tracker, a homogeneous
lead-tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator
sampling hadron calorimeter. Outside the superconducting solenoid lies
an iron yoke for magnetic flux-return instrumented with four stations
for muon detection. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the rapidity
coverage up to $\eta < 5$ and thus ensure good
hemiticity. Figure~\ref{fig:cmsDetector} shows an schematic representation
of the CMS detector and Figure~\ref{fig:cmsSlice} shows a cartoon
with a cross-sectional-slice view of the CMS detector along with
different particle detections.

This chapter presents an introduction to the CMS detector systems and
reconstruction algorithms. It is by no means a complete picture of the
CMS detector and its mostly based on Ref.~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk}.
\section{The Tracker System}
The tracker is the innermost system of the CMS detector.
It was designed to measure efficiently and precisely the trajectories
of charged particles coming from the interaction point, as well as to
provide a precise reconstruction of the secondary vertices at each
bunch crossing. When running at the LHC designed conditions, every
buch crossing, i.e 25 ns, the number of proton-proton collision will
be about 20 and they will produce an average number of particles of about
1000. These conditions and the above requirements implied a highly granular and fast
response design. That being said, this design due to its high power
consumption requires an efficient cooling system which in turn is in
conflict with the goal of minimizing the material budget and thus
reduce unwanted interactions.
