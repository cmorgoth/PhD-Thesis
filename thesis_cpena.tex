\begin{acknowledgements} 	 
  I would like to begin by thanking my adviser, Maria Spiropulu, whose
  knowledge and understanding of experimental High Energy Physics has
  guided me during my Ph.D. Maria's passion, integrity, and energy have
  truly inspired me and made working with her a remarkable
  experience. I would also like to thank Harvey Newman for his
  insightful and thoughtful help throught the completion of this
  dissertation. I also want to thank Bradley Filippone, my original
  adviser, for his guidance when arrived to Caltech and for his
  generosity, which allowed me to pursue my research interests that finally resulted in
  this thesis. 

I would also like to thank Adolf Bornheim, Yong Yang, and Jan Veverka
for guiding and helping me to successfully carry out the first projects within the
Caltech-CMS group. A special thank to Maurizio Pierini with whom I
worked on my first physics analysis; his support, patience, knowledge,
and insight 
throughout that project were a turning point in my career. I would really
like to thank Artur Apresyan and Si Xie with whom I have worked in
many physics analyses and detector research and development projects; I
truly value the discussions, lessons, encouragement, inspiration, and help they have
provided me. I would also like to thank Anatoly Ronzhin and Sergey
Loss, with whom I have worked in many beam test at Fermilab, for the
valuable discussions about particle detection. I want to also thank  Josh Bendavid for all 
his insightful comments and suggestions regarding my work in the later stages of my Ph.D.

To my friends Javier Duarte and Dustin Anderson, who also work on the
Caltech-CMS group, I want to thank them for all the discussions we ever
had, they have significantly contributed to the completion of this
dissertation. I would also like to thank Ana Brown, Kristen Boydstun,
Chen-Chih Hsu,
Tristan McKinney, Belinda Pang, and Ingmar Saberi for all the physics
and non-physics discussions we had.

I would also like to thank my undergraduate advisers and mentors; specially to William Brooks
for his enormous support, encouragement and inspiration; Hayk Hakobyan
for teaching me the essential programming skills that have been
proved so helpful during the last 5 years; finally to Viktor Slusarenko and
Jaime Glar\'ia for their invaluable guidance, and encouragement in the very early stages of my
education.


I would also like to thank all the people that have helped me in one
way or another to get to this point. To Jorge Pareja, Alejandra Ortiz,
Sebastian Pulgar for being so awesome as friends and roommates. To
Patricio Klenner and Alejandro Vargas for sharing their enthusiasm for
science with me. A special mention to Ren\'e Rios who encouraged me
to pursue along with him an education in Physics. To Orlando Soto for
sharing so many hours of study with me. I want to also thank my
friends in Pasadena, Ruby, Carlos, Valentina, George, Mari Cruz, and
Alejandro for sharing so many evenings and making me feel closer to
home. I thank the Chilean soccer national team for the two ``Copa
America'' championships, they have provided happiness when much
needed.

My deepest gratitude to my all my family, particularly my parents and brother,
Nancy, Ricardo, and David for all their love, support, hard work, and
encouragement throughout my whole life; and to my beloved wife, Camila,
for all her love, support, encouragement, understanding, and
unselfishness during all the time we have been together. I owe to all
of them a great deal, that is why this
dissertation is dedicated to them and my son to be, Nicanor.

\begin{abstract}
 In this thesis, we present several searches for beyond the standard
 model physics in proton-proton collisions recorded by the Compact
 Muon Solenoid Experiment at center-of-mass energy of 8 and 13\TeV. We
 search for particle dark matter in events with two or more jets and
 missing transverse momentum at $\sqrt{s} = 8$\TeV, in this search we use the razor
 variables to discriminate signal from background events and thus
 improve the overall sensitivity of the analysis. We observe
 agreement between the observation and the background estimation. The
 interpretation of the results is carried out in the context of an
 effective field theory that couples the standard model quarks to the
 dark matter candidate. A search for anomalous production of Higgs
 bosons using 15.3 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of  proton-proton collisions at
 $\sqrt{s} = 13$\TeV is also presented, this search selects events
 with a Higgs boson in association with jets, where the Higgs
 candidate decays into two photons. We
 also employ the razor variables ($\mathrm{M_{R}}, \mathrm{R}^{2}$) to discriminate signal from
 background. We observe an excess of events in one of the search bins
 with relatively high values of $\mathrm{M_{R}}$ and
 $\mathrm{R}^{2}$. The interpretation of this analysis is pair
 production of bottom squarks in the context of supersymmetry, this
 model is also presented in one of the appendices of this thesis. In
 the other appendix of this thesis, we present a search for new
 phenomena in high-mass diphoton events using 12.9 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of
 proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$\TeV. This search observed
 a significant excess (3.4 standard deviations, local) with 2015 data at a diphoton invariant mass of 750\GeV, equivalent to $\approx$ 20\% of
 the current dataset. By repeating the search with the larger dataset,
 we found that the
 observed excess has been greatly disfavored. Additionally, in order to confirm the robustness and correctness of this
 search, we have carried out an independent analysis, which indeed
 finds compatible results.

 We
 also present detector research and developments studies of
 electromagnetic calorimeters equipped with precision timing
 capabilities. We present several calorimeter prototypes that were
 tested at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. These prototypes include
 LYSO-based calorimeters, tungsten-LYSO ``shashlik'' sampling
 calorimeters, micro-channel-plate sampling calorimeters, and
 silicon-based sampling calorimeters. The results of these studies
 indicate that time resolutions of the order of $\sim$ 30 ps are
 readily available when measuring electromagnetic showers. A discussion about the
 applications of precision timing in high energy physics experiments is also
 presented, with a particular interest in pileup rejection in the
 context of the high-luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider.
